  <h1>Understanding different units in CSS</h1>

  <h2>Absoloute Units</h2>
  <div class="absos">
    <p>PX is an abosoloute unit because the size of a pixel does not change relatively. Only abosloute unit.</p>
    <p>REM for font size and PX for everything else - general rule of thumb</p>
    <p>PX - is a unit of length which roughly corresponds to the width or height of a single dot that can be comfortably seen by the human eye without strain, but is otherwise as small as possible. By definition, this is the physical size of a single pixel at a pixel density of 96 DPI, located an arms length away from the viewers eyes.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>relative units</h2>
  <div class="rela">
    <p>em and rem both refer to font size - Rule of thumb is favor REM - Shout outs to Michael Stipe</p>
    <p>em is relative to parent - if parents font size is 16px then 2em would be 32px - if fontsize of an element changes so will the value of em in the child element.</p>
    <p>rem however refers to the font size set in the root HTML element - meaning if parent and child within a HTML file have 2 rem both will be the SAME</p>
    <p class="summary">Using a relative unit does not discriminate against the 1% of users that change their default browser settings. If you want users to be able to boost the font size on their browser you should use em or rem.
      This being said modern browsers will scale even absoloute values(px) meaning this is really just a design choice but something to consider.

    <h3>viewports</h3>
    <div class="views">
      <p>Units VH and VW relate to the size of the viewport e.g. 1vh === 1%</p>
      <p class="VW">A little Volkswagen</p>
      <p class="VH">And a little VolksHagen emphasis on the H</p>
      <p>Can use the calc method to control this.</p>
