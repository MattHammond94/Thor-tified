      If you use the font-family property to change to a font and those fonts do not happen to be installed on your users computer, then a fallback font will be displayed.
      If you have not defined a fallback, then the default HTML font will be used, which is often somewhat ugly. For this reason, 
      its common to see somewhat long stacks of fonts listed on projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      Defaulting to the system font of a particular operating system can boost performance because the browser doesnt have to download any font files, 
      its using one it already had.
    </p>
    <p>The system font stack will go through each of those fonts until it finds one that is installed on the system, and then use that. its commonly used as it adds a neutral font style.</p>
